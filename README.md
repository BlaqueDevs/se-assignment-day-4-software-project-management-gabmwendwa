# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
***Version control*** is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific 1 versions later***GitHub*** is a popular tool because it aweb-based platform that provides hosting for version control using Git.
Version control plays a crucial role in maintaining project integrity in several ways:
-	***Preventing Code Loss:*** By tracking every change, version control prevents accidental code loss. If something goes wrong, you can always revert to a previous version.
-	***Facilitating Collaboration:*** It allows multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each other's changes.
-	***Ensuring Code Quality:*** Features like code reviews and pull requests help to ensure that only high-quality code is merged into the main codebase.
-	***Simplifying Bug Tracking:*** By tracking changes, version control makes it easier to identify the source of bugs.
-	***Enabling Experimentation:*** Branches allow developers to experiment with new features without risking the stability of the main codebase.
-	***Auditing Changes:*** It provides a detailed history of all changes, making it easy to audit the project and understand how it has evolved.
-	***Disaster Recovery:*** Having a remote repository on github ensures that even if local machines fail, the code is safe.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
### Key Steps:
#### Access GitHub:
-	First, you'll need a GitHub account. If you don't have one, sign up at GitHub.com.
-	Once logged in, you can begin the process.
#### Create a New Repository:
-	In the upper-right corner of any GitHub page, click the "+" dropdown menu, and then select "New repository."
#### Repository Details:
-	***Repository Name:*** Choose a clear and descriptive name for your repository.
-	***Description (Optional):*** Add a brief description of your project. This helps others understand the repository's purpose.
#### Visibility:
-	***Public:*** Anyone on the internet can see your repository.
-	***Private:*** Only you and people you explicitly grant access to can see your repository.
#### Initialize with:
-	***README:*** It is highly recommended to select this option. This creates a README.md file, which is a standard file for providing information about your project.
-	***gitignore:*** Choose a template for your .gitignore file based on the programming languages or frameworks you'll be using. This file tells Git which files and folders to ignore.
-	***License:*** Select a license for your project. This defines how others can use your code.
#### Create the Repository:
-	Click the "Create repository" button.
### Important Decisions:
#### Repository Name:
-	Choose a name that is concise, descriptive, and easy to remember.
#### Repository Visibility:
-	Decide whether your repository should be public or private.
-	Public repositories are ideal for open-source projects or projects you want to share with the world.
-	Private repositories are suitable for sensitive projects or projects you want to keep confidential.
#### .gitignore:
-	Selecting the correct .gitignore template is crucial. It prevents unnecessary files (like temporary files or sensitive data) from being committed to your repository.
#### License:
-	Choosing a license is essential for open-source projects. It clarifies how others can use, modify, and distribute your code.
-	Consider researching common open-source licenses (like MIT, Apache 2.0, or GPL) to find one that aligns with your goals.
#### README:
-	Creating a good README file is very important. It is the first thing that people see when visiting your repository. It should explain the purpose of the project, how to use it, and any other relevant information.
#### After Creating the Repository:
-	Once your repository is created, you can start adding files, making commits, and collaborating with others.
-	You can then use Git commands within your local machine, to connect with the remote repository that you created on Github.
